# Place info

This repo is used for showing place info. It uses `/place-info` and sens query parameter of place id. In order to get place info, you need place id. These two are valid place ids: `GXvPAor1ifNfpF0U5PTG0w` and `ohGSnJtMIC5nPfYRi_HTAg`

## Installation

### Pre-requisites

- `nvm`
- `yarn`

### Install

1. `cd` into this directory
2. Run `nvm use && yarn`

## Usage

- `yarn start` to start dev mode

- `yarn build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

- `yarn test` to run the unit tests
- `yarn test --watch` to run in watch mode

The tests are run by Jest, so any other valid Jest CLI options may also be
passed.

## TODO

- add absolute imports
- add tests for app.tsx
- improve UI :D
- reuse types from BE
- folder structure (for some reason I have place-fe/place-fe/...)
